# Lenovo T490 macOS with OpenCore

### Status: WIP

This repo contains information for getting macOS 10.15 Catalina working on a Lenovo T490 laptop.

The compatibility is good for the most part, most of the stuff works like it would on a real macbook, including camera, audio, trackpad, iCloud services. The experience is pleasant, as the laptop is smooth and responsive under macOS Catalina. Battery life isn't great (from personal experience Arch Linux is better and Windows 10 the best of the three), but that can probably be fixed with undervolting. The Intel WiFi card is soldered onto the motherboard, which means it can't be replaced with a Broadcom one, but the Intel card is now functional albeit not operating at full speeds - I am getting 50/10 mbit up/down on a 200/20 connection, which is fine for most use cases.

Currently running:

| Component      | Version |

| BIOS version   | 0.1.66            |
| EC version     | 0.1.19            |

### Working, sort of

### Not working at the moment

- [ ] SD card reader - I don't use it so won't fix but will merge pull requests

### Not tested

- [ ] USB type C video
- [ ] HDMI video at 4K
- [ ] Thunderbolt

## Pre-Install & BIOS settings
First, read the [Dortania OC guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). The guide will take you through the creation of installation USB and drive formatting. Update to the latest firmware (the easiest way is to use fwupd on linux). 

Then do the following BIOS settings:
- Disable secure chip
- Enable Intel Virtualization and VT-d
- Disable secure boot and fast boot
- Disable Intel SGX control
- Disable Device Guard
- Disable wake on LAN/thunderbolt
- Set boot mode to UEFI only, disable CSM support

Now you can install macOS on your APFS or HFS+ formatted drive. 

## Post-install
- [Fix iServices](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) if you want to use iMessage or FaceTime.
- Install [HeliPort](https://github.com/zxystd/HeliPort) to control the wifi kext from within macOS
- Put your wifi ssid and password inside itlwm kext's Info.plist to automatically connect to wifi without using HeliPort
- Disable hibernation, since it doesn't work properly on hackintoshes
- Make your own USB map kext
- Generate your own CPU frequency vectors using [CPUFriendFriend](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend). The one included here is set to Balance power and CPU lowest frequency set to 500 MHz 
- Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) for brightness keys (and other keyboard rebindings). I recommend applying changes only to the keyboard, since I've had some conflicts with my Logitech mouse. 
- (Optional) [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) for window management
- (Optional) [LuLu](https://github.com/objective-see/LuLu) for network traffic control
